## Structural Analysis of Small Cell Lung Cancer Transcription Factor Network
This repository provides source MATLAB codes to reproduce our results of the structural analysis of Small Cell Lung Cancer Transcription Factor network using Dense Spanning Trees (DST) and Minimum Dense Spanning Trees (MDST). The manuscript is currently under review and a preprint is available on [BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.01.535226). A link will be provided once it is published.


Here we utilized our previously published Dense(or Sparse) Spanning Tree methods whose source codes are available [here](https://github.com/mustafaozen/Dense-Sparse-Spanning-Trees).
