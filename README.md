## Structural Analysis of Small Cell Lung Cancer Transcription Factor Network
This repository provides source MATLAB codes to reproduce our results of the structural analysis of Small Cell Lung Cancer transcription factor network using Dense Spanning Trees (DST) and Minimum Dense Spanning Trees (MDST). The manuscript is currently under review and a preprint is available on [BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.01.535226). A link will be provided once it is published.


Here we utilized our previously published Dense(or Sparse) Spanning Tree methods whose source codes and detailed explanations are available [here](https://github.com/mustafaozen/Dense-Sparse-Spanning-Trees) and [here](http://www.iapress.org/index.php/soic/article/view/855).

To reproduce the results, some of the source DST/MDST files are needed which couldn't be uploaded here due to large file sizes. However, they will be made available upon request. Please email to: mozen@altoslabs.com or clopez@altoslabs.com. Nevertheless, using the source codes, one can generate new DSTs/MDSTs and rerun all the analysis on them. In this case, the results may slightly change due to the stochastic nature of the optimization solvers used to observe DSTs/MDSTs, but the trend will be the same.
